1. Begin by marking off the proper height from the floor on your wall (5’8” or 1.73m). The bottom of the u-shaped channel should be at this height.
2. Apply the metal Mounting Feet to the back of your dartboard, using the Stabilizer Screws. If your dartboard came with round plastic Spacers instead, use a hammer to nail each one into the back of your dartboard. Make sure they're spaced evenly, making a triangular shape.
3. Drive the Dartboard Center Screw into the pre-drilled hole, leaving space to hang the dartboard onto the Mounting Bracket. See our additional tips below for proper screw depth.
4. Use the two Bracket Mounting Screws to install the Mounting Bracket to your wall, using wall anchors if not positioned over a stud.
5. Place the dartboard onto the Mounting Bracket and check for tightness against the wall. If the dartboard is wobbling, remove and tighten or loosen the Dartboard Mounting Screw as needed.

**Additional Dartboard Hanging Tips**
Getting the dartboard's center screw height adjusted to the proper depth can be a little tricky. Below is a depth guide illustration to help you understand how much of the screw should be left sticking out of the back of the dartboard.

If the screw is tightened too far into the dartboard (first illustration - see website link), there won't be enough left of it to hook onto the bracket. If the screw isn't screwed into the board enough (second illustration), it will hook onto the bracket but will be off balance and wobbly. It might take a few tries to lower or raise the center screw until the dartboard no longer wobbles.
