==== Embarking on Epic Adventures: ====
	Adventures are the heart and soul of your journey, serving as the primary catalyst for the game's progression. Each Adventure Card unfurls a captivating "Dungeon" that demands your unwavering commitment to conquer. It's a thrilling quest that you must see through to its conclusion, except for rare circumstances that offer a unique twist.
	
	Within each adventure, you'll encounter a structured path of milestones. These include 5 Major Milestones (known as [[Understanding Encounters]]) and 5 Minor Milestones (comprising Encounter Activities). Your adventure reaches its climax with a showdown against a formidable final boss, known for its formidable challenge.
	
	Upon vanquishing the 5th Primary Enemy, your party's triumph is rewarded with the discovery of a precious [[Interpereting Treasures|Treasure Horde]]. This moment of glory also marks the appearance of a portal, conveniently situated at the very spot on that card. This portal serves as a gateway to a new town, enabling you to embark on fresh adventures and return to this pivotal location from any town portal. It's a thrilling cycle that keeps your journey dynamic and full of new possibilities. So, prepare to immerse yourself in epic adventures, as they hold the key to progression, treasures, and exciting travel across the captivating realm of Astralor.
