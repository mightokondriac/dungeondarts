	Activities are a vibrant part of your adventure, scattered throughout the game. They appear primarily in [[Towns|Town Cards]] and [[Merchants|Merchant Cards]], offering you a diverse range of experiences. But that's not all â€“ every [[Encounters|Encounter Card]] introduces unique activities before or after your thrilling battles with formidable enemies. These activities can vary from simple yet intriguing puzzles to challenges as intricate and perilous as the enemies you face. Embrace these opportunities with enthusiasm, for they hold the key to unlocking treasures, honing your skills, and expanding your horizons in the world of [[5.World|Astralor]]. So, embark on your journey and prepare for a world where every encounter promises excitement and rewards, where activities can be just as thrilling as the battles themselves.
