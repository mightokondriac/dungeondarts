====== October 2023 ======
'''
In October's arms, the world transforms,
A whimsical dance, nature performs.
Leaves flutter down in hues of gold,
As autumn's story begins to unfold.

The air is crisp, a gentle chill,
As cozy scarves and sweaters fill the bill.
Pumpkins grin with toothy delight,
In the enchanting glow of Halloween night.

Apples hang from branches low,
Ready for picking in orchards that glow.
With cinnamon and spice, they're baked to perfection,
A delicious treat, a warm confection.

The forest dons a vibrant coat,
A tapestry of red, orange, and gold, remote.
Mushrooms peek from mossy floors,
In hidden realms, nature explores.

October's moon, a harvest's friend,
Casts its silver glow without end.
In the darkness, its light guides the way,
For creatures of the night at play.

Witches cackle, ghosts take flight,
In this whimsical October night.
A season of magic and delight,
As we bid farewell to summer's light.

So let's celebrate this special time,
With apple cider and prose that rhyme.
In October's arms, we find our grace,
In its whimsy and beauty, we find our place.
