There are about 112 massive trees on this world, known as Astralor. These trees are living entities that live and love and remember and regret. These trees, if you can call them that, are absolutely collosall. several small villages can easily sit in its roots and amongtst its branches. the main story takes place after a century of the locals discoving 3 journals written by a woman named Valearian Trorav'sh. She had delved into the long abandoned, ancient TreeHomes that had been corrupted in the later days, when the children moved from thier homes and the Houryam itself began to decay: there she found monsters of shadow and power she could barely explain. she was quick and keen and kept her wits and was able to make her way through the levels. After a few of her entries on the various monsters and the treasures that were spoken of, the party set on their way to the first location called The Cavern of Shadows, near Oakshade.
