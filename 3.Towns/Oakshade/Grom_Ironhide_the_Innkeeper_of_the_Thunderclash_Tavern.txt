====== Grom Ironhide the Innkeeper of the Thunderclash Tavern ======
Created Monday 16 October 2023

Grom is a hulking figure, known for his hearty laughter and booming voice. His inn is a sanctuary for battle-hardened adventurers, offering comfortable lodgings and nourishing food. However, the real draw is his expansive training ground, where warriors spar, test their mettle, and seek to improve their combat skills.
