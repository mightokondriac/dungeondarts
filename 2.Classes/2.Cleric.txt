**Description:**
The Cleric is a divine conduit, an emissary chosen to wield the sacred powers granted by the deities of the world. They serve as healers, spiritual guides, and protectors of the faith. With a strong connection to the divine, Clerics channel this energy to mend wounds, purify spirits, and, in dire situations, smite their enemies with righteous fury. Their versatile abilities can turn the tide of battle, bestowing blessings on their comrades to enhance their resilience, or calling down divine retribution on those who threaten the balance of the world. It is the calling of the Cleric to tend to the spiritual and physical needs of their party, whether through powerful healing magic, fortifying wards, or leading their group with unwavering faith.
