<b>Our Epic Journey: Crafting a Unique Game</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
This incredible adventure began with just "two guys and a dartboard." We set out to transform the traditional dart game Cricket into a collaborative and imaginative version, infusing it with the spirit of Dungeons and Dragons. The core idea was simple yet groundbreaking: instead of competing individually, we made it collaborative, turning every number into an epic battle with its own hit points.
</p>
<br>
<p>
In this new version, the players collectively focus on a single number, aiming to "deplete" its hit points. Picture it like this: you're facing an enemy with Armor Class 16 (akin to hitting a 16 on the board), and your success in this hit can vary from x1 (hitting the number) to x2 (hitting the double) or x3 (triple) and even x4 (single bullseye) and x5 (double bullseye). Then, we introduced the concept of dealing damage to these foes.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<i>For instance, with your 3 base darts, you might throw a 16, a 4, and then a single bullseye. These are followed by damage darts that deal varying amounts of damage. Let's say you throw a 7 (x1) and then a 16 (x4). The result? A whopping 71 points of damage inflicted on that enemy.</i>
</div>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Our journey didn't stop at combat. We all love a good treasure hunt, and thus, we introduced treasures into the game, each one waiting to be uncovered and claimed. And here we stand today, deeply immersed in crafting powerful items and weaving captivating stories behind them.
</p>
<br>
<p>
We relish in creating adventures that you'd want to replay with your friends again and again. It's the joy of building these intricate worlds, featuring awe-inspiring monsters and enthralling narratives that can span years. Join us on a quest filled with powerful magical items, legendary beasts to battle, and stories to partake in. Our journey has only just begun, and we invite you to become a part of it.

<b>Children</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Very young children should never be allowed to play with darts. Darts can cause serious injuries to a toddler if they poke themselves in the eye.</li>
<li>Older children should be supervised at all times when playing the game.</li>
<li>It's a good idea to buy youngsters a set of soft tipped darts and board. The board is made of plastic and has small holes cast into it. The soft tip darts stick to the board in the small holes. This type of dart is a lot safer than metal tipped ones and are less likely to cause an injury if they strike anyone. .</li>
<li>Never leave flights lying around as a toddler can put them in their mouth and choke on them.</li>
<li>Keep your darts somewhere that is out of reach of small children.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Dart Safety</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Never set up your dartboard on the back of a door. Anyone who is not aware that you are playing could easily be struck if they opened the door.</li>
<li>Make sure the dartboard is securely fitted to the wall. There have been cases when small children, and some adults, have suffered head injuries when a dart board has fallen on them. Darts also rebound more easily if the board is not secured.</li>
<li>Never point, or throw a dart at anyone.</li>
<li>Don't stand near a dartboard when someone is throwing. A dart might rebound and hit you.</li>
<li>Don't walk in front of a dartboard when people are playing.</li>
<li>Make sure the dartboard is set up well away from any busy areas, or anywhere people might be passing.</li>
<li>If watching or playing always stand behind the player.</li>
<li>Make sure anything that is breakable is moved away from the surrounding area. Darts have a habit of rebounding at some strange angles.</li>
</ul>

<li>Begin by marking off the proper height from the floor on your wall (5’8” or 1.73m). The bottom of the u-shaped channel should be at this height.</li>
<li>Apply the metal Mounting Feet to the back of your dartboard, using the Stabilizer Screws. If your dartboard came with round plastic Spacers instead, use a hammer to nail each one into the back of your dartboard. Make sure they're spaced evenly, making a triangular shape.</li>
<li>Drive the Dartboard Center Screw into the pre-drilled hole, leaving space to hang the dartboard onto the Mounting Bracket. See our additional tips below for proper screw depth.</li>
<li>Use the two Bracket Mounting Screws to install the Mounting Bracket to your wall, using wall anchors if not positioned over a stud.</li>
<li>Place the dartboard onto the Mounting Bracket and check for tightness against the wall. If the dartboard is wobbling, remove and tighten or loosen the Dartboard Mounting Screw as needed.</li>

<br>
<p>
<b>Additional Dartboard Hanging Tips</b><br>
Getting the dartboard's center screw height adjusted to the proper depth can be a little tricky. Below is a depth guide illustration to help you understand how much of the screw should be left sticking out of the back of the dartboard.
</p>
<br>
<p>
If the screw is tightened too far into the dartboard (first illustration - see website link), there won't be enough left of it to hook onto the bracket. If the screw isn't screwed into the board enough (second illustration), it will hook onto the bracket but will be off balance and wobbly. It might take a few tries to lower or raise the center screw until the dartboard no longer wobbles.

<br>
<p>
In the Attack Step, use the amount of Attack Darts your character has available to attempt to hit the AC of the Enemy you are battling.<br>
Attack Darts are "Successful" if they hit the AC(or higher) of the Enemy you are battling, however the exact AC slice is called a "Direct Hit". Direct Hits are the only Success that adds xMods to the resulting Damage Dart.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Attack Darts Explanation:<a id="attack-darts-explanation" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>
<br>
<p>
In the game, "Attack Darts" are your primary resource for engaging in combat and attempting to strike your enemy. These darts are used during the Attack Step, where you try to hit the Armor Class (AC) of the enemy you are battling.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Here's how Attack Darts work</b>:
</p>
<br>
<ol style='padding-left: 30pt' type="1" start="1">
<li><u>Attack Step</u>: During the Attack Step, you'll use the combined number of Attack Darts at your disposal, which includes your Base Darts plus any bonus Attack Darts from various sources. These darts are crucial for determining the success of your offensive actions.</li>
<li><u>Hitting the AC</u>: Attack Darts are considered "Successful" when they hit the AC of the enemy you are battling or exceed it. Successfully hitting the AC is your primary goal during combat.</li>
<li><u>Direct Hits</u>: Within the category of Successful Attack Darts, there's a special level of success known as a "Direct Hit." A Direct Hit occurs when your dart lands precisely on a specific section of the target, such as the bullseye or another designated area.</li>
<li><u>xMods for Direct Hits</u>: Direct Hits are the only type of success that allows you to apply special modifiers (xMods) to the resulting Damage Dart. The specific xMods include:
<ol type="a" start="1">
<li>Double Ring: x2 damage.</li>
<li>Triple: x3 damage.</li>
<li>Bullseye: x4 damage.</li>
<li>Double Bullseye: x5 damage.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<i>Note that Bullseye types are always considered Direct Hits.</i>
</div>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Understanding Attack Darts and the concept of Direct Hits is vital for combat effectiveness in the game. The better you are at achieving Direct Hits, the more damage you can deal to your enemies. Plan your attacks carefully and use your Attack Darts strategically to maximize your damage output and increase your chances of victory in battles.

</p>
<br>
<p>
Base Darts is a reference to the amount of darts your character has to apply to the Attack and Damage stages. Other Status Effects and Abilities can change this number permentently or temporarily.<br>
If you have 3 Base Darts, you use 3 darts in your Attack Step. However if you have an ability that gives you an additional Base Dart, you use 4 darts in the Attack step.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>Base Darts Explanation:</b><a id="base-darts-explanation" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>
<br>
<p>
In the game, "Base Darts" serve as the fundamental unit for assessing and calculating various aspects of gameplay. These darts represent your foundational resource and determine your ability to perform actions, engage in combat, and make decisions throughout the game.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Here's how Base Darts work</b>:
</p>
<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li><u>Dart Allocation</u>: At the start of each turn or encounter, players are allocated a specific number of Base Darts. This allocation is often influenced by your character's class, abilities, and equipment. These darts serve as the pool from which you draw resources for your actions.</li>
<li><u>Resource Management</u>: You'll need to strategically manage your Base Darts during your turn or when making choices in the game. Different actions and decisions may require varying numbers of darts, so it's crucial to use them wisely to achieve your objectives.</li>
<li><u>Influence on Abilities</u>: Base Darts can also impact your character's abilities and the success of your actions. The more Base Darts you allocate to a specific action, the higher your chances of success. It's a balance between conserving darts and using them to your advantage.</li>
<li><u>Combat and Challenges</u>: In combat situations or when facing challenges, you'll typically use Base Darts to determine the outcome. The number of darts allocated can affect the damage you deal, your defense against enemy attacks, and your overall performance in these situations.</li>
<li><u>Dart Upgrades</u>: As you progress in the game and level up, you may acquire upgrades or abilities that allow you to modify the number of Base Darts you receive or how they can be used. These enhancements can significantly impact your gameplay.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
Understanding the role of Base Darts is essential to strategic decision-making and success in the game. Make sure to manage them effectively, adapt to different situations, and explore ways to enhance your Base Dart allocation as you progress in your adventure.

<p>
When a Dart fully bounces out of the dartboard(not Stick and Fall) from hitting a wire, that dart is not Recoverable until the Regroup stage on the Round after next. 
</p>
<br>
<h3>Bounced Darts Explanation:<a id="bounced-darts-explanation" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>
<br>
<p>
In the game, "Bounced Darts" represent darts that do not hit the dartboard properly and fully bounce out after striking a wire or other obstruction. These darts are temporarily unrecoverable until the "Regroup" stage, which occurs after the end of the <a href="#1.Rules:Complete Turn Breakdown" title="Complete Turn" class="page">Complete Turn</a>. Think of it as akin to rolling a 1 on a six-sided die in Dungeons and Dragons, where a critical failure has occurred.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Here's a breakdown of Bounced Darts and their impact</b>:
</p>
<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li><u>Dart Inaccuracy</u>: When you throw a dart and it hits a wire on the dartboard, it may not stick to the board as intended. Instead, it bounces out of the board, indicating an inaccurate throw.</li>
<li><u>Recovery Delay</u>: Bounced Darts cannot be retrieved immediately. They remain out of play until the "Regroup" stage, which occurs during the round that comes after the next full round of play. This delay reflects the time it takes to find, retrieve, or replace the darts.</li>
<li><u>Gameplay Impact</u>: The delay in recovering Bounced Darts affects your dart resources. You'll need to carefully manage your remaining darts, especially if Bounced Darts accumulate, to ensure you have enough for future throws.</li>
<li><u>Critical Failures</u>: Similar to rolling a 1 in Dungeons and Dragons, Bounced Darts represent an unfortunate and unintended outcome in the game. These critical failures can disrupt your strategy, adding an element of unpredictability to the game.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
Understanding Bounced Darts is important for players to adapt to the occasional setbacks they bring. Plan your throws carefully, consider the risk of hitting wires, and manage your dart resources to maximize your chances of success in the game.

In the Damage Step, use the amount of Damage Darts your character has available to attempt to hit the highest possible number. Double and Triple rings are not calculated for Damage Darts(if you hit a Triple 20 with a Damage Dart, it is still only 20 damage. If you hit a Triple on the required AC, then the corresponding Damage Dart would be 20x3, dealing 60 damage to the enemy.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Damage Darts Explanation:<a id="damage-darts-explanation" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>
<br>
<p>
In the game, "Damage Darts" represent the resource you use to determine the amount of damage your character inflicts on the enemy during the Damage Step. Understanding how Damage Darts work is crucial for effectively measuring and dealing damage in combat.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Here's how Damage Darts operate</b>:
</p>
<br>
<ol style='padding-left: 30pt' type="1" start="1">
<li><u>Damage Step</u>: During the Damage Step, you'll use the combined number of Damage Darts at your disposal. These darts determine the extent of damage you can deliver to your opponent.</li>
<li><u>Highest Possible Number</u>: Unlike Attack Darts, where you aim for specific sections of the target, with Damage Darts, your goal is to hit the highest possible number on the dartboard. The value you hit represents the amount of damage you inflict.</li>
<li><u>Double and Triple Rings</u>: Notably, double and triple rings on the dartboard are not calculated for Damage Darts. For example, if you hit a Triple 20 with a Damage Dart, it's still considered 20 damage, without any multiplication. However, it's important to distinguish between Attack Darts and Damage Darts:
<ol type="a" start="1">
<li>If you previously hit a Triple on the required AC with an Attack Dart (refer to Attack Darts), and then you hit a 20 with the corresponding Damage Dart, it would result in 20x3 damage, dealing a significant 60 damage to the enemy. This multiplication is specific to the Attack Darts step.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
Understanding Damage Darts is essential for determining your character's damage output during combat. Aim for high numbers to maximize your damage potential and strategically use Damage Darts to defeat your opponents effectively.

Enemy Natural Abilities represent the inherent capabilities and characteristics of adversaries in your journey. These abilities are continuously active and come into play as soon as you engage in battle with an enemy. While Triggered Abilities often require specific conditions to activate, Natural Abilities are ever-present, making them a vital aspect of enemy encounters.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Understanding Natural Abilities:<a id="understanding-natural-abilities" class="h_anchor"></a></h4>
<br>
<p>
Upon initiating combat with an enemy, you'll encounter their Natural Abilities, which are not marked with any Trigger indicator. These abilities encompass a wide range of powers and traits, from elemental resistances to innate combat tactics.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Versatile and Unpredictable:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
Natural Abilities can encompass a wide variety of effects and tactics that enemies may employ. Some enemies possess unique resistances to specific damage types, while others may have advanced movement or attack patterns. Understanding and adapting to these Natural Abilities is crucial for devising effective strategies.
</div>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Status Effects on Natural Abilities:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
Status Effects can be used strategically to target and modify an enemy's Natural Abilities. For instance, applying a debilitating status effect could temporarily weaken an enemy's innate resistances, providing an advantage to players during the encounter.
</div>
</p>
<br>
<p>
As you embark on your adventures in Astralor, be prepared to face enemies with a diverse array of Natural Abilities. Learning to adapt and exploit their strengths and weaknesses will be essential for your party's success in your quest.

<h4>Interpreting Triggered Abilities:<a id="interpreting-triggered-abilities" class="h_anchor"></a></h4>
<p>
(See <a href="#1.Rules:Interpereting Encounters" title="Interpreting Encounters" class="page">Interpreting Encounters</a>)<br>
Triggered Abilities are indicated by a specific condition on the left side of the enemy's card. For example, when the Shimmersnake reaches half of its hit points, it activates an ability that forces all players to flip a coin on their first successful Attack Dart. If a player fails to call the flip correctly, that Attack Dart misses.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Understanding and preparing for these Triggered Abilities is essential for a successful campaign. They can introduce a dynamic element to encounters, requiring players to adapt and strategize as conditions change. Be vigilant and ready to face a variety of challenges in your quest through Astralor.

<h3>Natural Abilities Explanation:<a id="natural-abilities-explanation" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>
<br>
<p>
In the game, "Natural Abilities" are inherent powers or skills possessed by the player character. These abilities are always active and persist throughout the entire campaign, enhancing your character's capabilities as they level up. Here's a detailed breakdown of Natural Abilities:
</p>
<br>
<ol style='padding-left: 30pt' type="1" start="1">
<li><u>Activation and Duration</u>: When a player gains a level and unlocks a new Natural Ability, that ability immediately becomes active. Unlike other game abilities that may need to be triggered, Natural Abilities are "always active." They remain in effect for the entire duration of the campaign, providing a consistent enhancement to your character's abilities.</li>
<li><u>Exclusion of Enemy Abilities</u>: Players are restricted from acquiring abilities categorized as "Enemy type." This means you can only acquire and activate Natural Abilities that benefit the player character. Enemy-type abilities are typically reserved for non-playable entities within the game.</li>
<li><u>Status Effects</u>: Importantly, status effects, which are in-game conditions or alterations, can target Player Natural Abilities. This means that during the course of the game, various effects, buffs, or debuffs can impact or interact with your Natural Abilities, potentially enhancing or modifying their effects based on the situation.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
Understanding Natural Abilities is critical for players, as these abilities serve as a fundamental and continuous source of enhancement and strategic advantage throughout the campaign. Players must consider how these abilities interact with status effects and manage their characters accordingly.

<h3>Special Abilities Explanation:<a id="special-abilities-explanation" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>
<br>
<p>
In the game, "Special Abilities" are unique powers or skills that can significantly impact the course of gameplay. Understanding how these abilities are activated and when they can be used is crucial. Here's a detailed explanation:
</p>
<br>
<ol style='padding-left: 30pt' type="1" start="1">
<li><u>Self-Targeted Special Abilities</u>: Special Abilities that target only the player using them, including those that affect darts, can be activated at any time. These abilities can be triggered whenever the player deems it strategically advantageous.</li>
<li><u>Player-Targeted Special Abilities</u>: Special Abilities that target all other players in the game require the expenditure of a "Special Ability Point." This activation takes place during the Regroup Stage, a designated phase of the game where players come together to make collective decisions and activate special abilities that affect other players.</li>
<li><u>Special Abilities Targeting Enemies with Status Effects</u>: Special Abilities that target enemies afflicted with a status effect must also be activated during the Regroup Stage. This ensures coordinated and strategic use of these abilities against affected foes.</li>
<li><u>Special Abilities Targeting Enemies with Direct Damage</u>: Special Abilities that focus on causing direct damage to enemies can be activated at any time. These abilities provide players with flexibility in choosing the right moment to unleash their offensive potential.</li>
<li><u>Exclusion of Enemy Abilities</u>: Players cannot gain abilities classified as "Enemy type." This restriction ensures that players have access only to abilities that benefit them, rather than those typically reserved for non-playable entities within the game.</li>
<li><u>Interaction with Status Effects</u>: It's important to note that status effects, which are in-game conditions or alterations, can also target Player Special Abilities. These effects may modify or enhance the outcomes of special abilities, adding an extra layer of strategy and complexity to the game.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
Understanding Special Abilities is vital for players, as they can greatly influence the outcome of the game. Knowing when and how to activate these abilities, and how they interact with status effects, is key to developing effective strategies and gaining an advantage in the gameplay.

<b>Description:</b><br>
The Rogue, often shrouded in darkness and cloaked in mystery, is a master of stealth, guile, and opportunism. Renowned for their cunning wit and nimble agility, they navigate treacherous paths and unforgiving terrain with remarkable dexterity. Rogues are experts in the art of subterfuge, specializing in thievery, traps, and lock-picking. They are not limited to mere pilfering, though; Rogues excel in hand-to-hand combat, utilizing precision and finesse to strike at their adversaries' weakest points. Adept at infiltration and surprise, they can vanish into the shadows in a heartbeat, reappearing to strike with deadly accuracy. With a versatile set of skills and an innate sense for exploiting vulnerabilities, Rogues are invaluable members of any adventuring party, contributing both in subtle, behind-the-scenes operations and open, face-to-face combat.

The Sorcerer harnesses the raw, untamed power of arcane energies, channeling them through sheer force of will. These magic users are born with a rare gift, an innate connection to the mystical energies that flow through the world. Unlike the methodical wizards who study spells and incantations, Sorcerers rely on their intuition, their emotions, and their inherent talents to wield magic. They can command the elements, summon mystical allies, and cast devastating spells with a mere thought. Sorcerers often exhibit a deep, intrinsic connection to their chosen element, allowing them to perform incredible feats of destruction, healing, and transformation. Their powers are a double-edged sword, as the same magic that brings life to the world can also bring destruction. Masters of the unpredictable, Sorcerers are forces to be reckoned with, capable of unleashing both catastrophe and salvation with a single incantation.

<li>Stick and Fall</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Bounced Darts Explanation:<a id="bounced-darts-explanation" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>
<br>
<p>
When a Dart fully bounces out of the dartboard(not Stick and Fall) from hitting a wire, that dart is not Recoverable until the Regroup stage on the Round after next. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
In the game, "Bounced Darts" represent darts that do not hit the dartboard properly and fully bounce out after striking a wire or other obstruction. These darts are temporarily unrecoverable until the "Regroup" stage, which occurs after the end of the <a href="#1.Rules:Complete Turn Breakdown" title="Complete Turn" class="page">Complete Turn</a>. Think of it as akin to rolling a 1 on a six-sided die in Dungeons and Dragons, where a critical failure has occurred.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Here's a breakdown of Bounced Darts and their impact</b>:
</p>
<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li><u>Dart Inaccuracy</u>: When you throw a dart and it hits a wire on the dartboard, it may not stick to the board as intended. Instead, it bounces out of the board, indicating an inaccurate throw.</li>
<li><u>Recovery Delay</u>: Bounced Darts cannot be retrieved immediately. They remain out of play until the "Regroup" stage, which occurs during the round that comes after the next full round of play. This delay reflects the time it takes to find, retrieve, or replace the darts.</li>
<li><u>Gameplay Impact</u>: The delay in recovering Bounced Darts affects your dart resources. You'll need to carefully manage your remaining darts, especially if Bounced Darts accumulate, to ensure you have enough for future throws.</li>
<li><u>Critical Failures</u>: Similar to rolling a 1 in Dungeons and Dragons, Bounced Darts represent an unfortunate and unintended outcome in the game. These critical failures can disrupt your strategy, adding an element of unpredictability to the game.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
Understanding Bounced Darts is important for players to adapt to the occasional setbacks they bring. Plan your throws carefully, consider the risk of hitting wires, and manage your dart resources to maximize your chances of success in the game.

Separating the interface of "information about a thing" vs "the content of this card" - how to display it is starting to make more sense. I want to start including as many technical advantages to this game as possible. qr to voice, responding to events within the card prompted by the player. "heyyy i just got a triple 16" and the app asks "did you just hit a 16(x3)" ... yes.. bang it calculates, you shout, "a 6 and a 12" ... you hit well with your first strike, but on your second and final strike you draw you weapon down through your enemy, doing 36 damage for a total of ____.<br>
and so on. $$$

<h3>original stream of thought:<a id="original-stream-of-thought" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>
<br>
<p>
Basically this game started with the dart game Cricket and how to turn it into a dungeons and dragons version of this game of dart. Simply put we made it collaborative instead of competitive, and each number had hitpoints. meaning that instead of each player having to hit a number individually and closing them out or making points on those numbers, the players focus on a single number and try to "deplete" its hitpoints. for instance, in this version we are trying to hit Armor Class 16(hitting a 16 on the board) and the varying degree of the success of this hit (x1(hitting the number), x2(hitting the double on that number), x3(triple on that number), x4(single bullseye), x5(double bullseye)). Then we were doing damage finally to these enemies. Lets say, with my 3 base darts, i throw a 16, a 4, and then a single bullseye. I then have damage darts that are x1, (missed), x4. I throw a 7(x1) and then a 16(x4) dealing 71 points of damage to that enemy. We then wanted treasure (who doesn't?), so we made treasures you could get. and then here we are. we love making crazy powerful items and stories for and why they are what they are. we love making adventures that you would want to play with your friends over and over again. join our adventure of crazy powerful magical items and badass monsters to fight, and a story to take part in that will last for years. The quest that gives years, not take them.

<sup>There are about 112 massive trees on this world, known as Astralor. These trees are living entities that live and love and remember and regret. These trees, if you can call them that, are absolutely collosall. several small villages can easily sit in its roots and amongtst its branches. the main story takes place after a century of the locals discoving 3 journals written by a woman named Valearian Trorav'sh. She had delved into the long abandoned, ancient TreeHomes that had been corrupted in the later days, when the children moved from thier homes and the Houryam itself began to decay: there she found monsters of shadow and power she could barely explain. she was quick and keen and kept her wits and was able to make her way through the levels. After a few of her entries on the various monsters and the treasures that were spoken of, the party set on their way to the first location called The Cavern of Shadows, near Oakshade.</sup> 
</p>
<br>

<hr>
<p>
In the world of Astralor, a vast and ancient realm, 112 colossal trees stand as living, sentient entities. Each of these immense arboreal giants has stood for millennia, their roots digging deep into the earth, their branches reaching high into the sky. These aren't just trees; they are the Tree Gods of Astralor, and their presence has shaped the fate of the world.
</p>
<br>
<p>
These <a href="#index:NOTES:Crest Story Arc:Tree Gods" title="Tree Gods" class="page">Tree Gods</a> are more than mere plants; they have memories, emotions, and the wisdom of ages. They've witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, the changing of the seasons, and the dance of life in their shadowy groves. These majestic trees have long been the sanctuaries and homes of the <a href="#index:NOTES:Crest Story Arc:Dwellers" title="Dwellers" class="page">Dwellers</a>, the people of the forests and fields. Entire villages have found refuge within the embrace of their colossal roots, while countless creatures have sought shelter amid their sprawling branches.
</p>
<br>
<p>
But, like any living entity, these ancient tree beings can suffer and wither. In recent times, a creeping blight has taken root, infecting these venerable Tree Gods. It's as if a malevolent force is corrupting the very life essence of Astralor itself. Some believe it to be dark and twisted magic, while others see it as a natural transition, signaling the end of the Age of the Tree Gods, making way for the Dwellers to reclaim the forests.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Yet, there are whispers of a darker truth. Rumors abound that some of the Tree Gods themselves have succumbed to the allure of the shadows, willingly embracing the corruption that now threatens their kin. It is this inner turmoil among the Lords of the Treehome that may hold the key to understanding the origins of the blight.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The answer to this enigma lies shrouded in myth and mystery, hidden within the depths of the <a href="#index:NOTES:Crest Story Arc:Treehomes" title="Treehomes" class="page">Treehomes</a> themselves. And so, the fate of Astralor is at stake. An ancient prophecy speaks of a group of heroes who will embark on a quest, guided by the winds of destiny, seeking out the truth within the very heart of these colossal beings.
</p>
<br>
<p>
In the village of <a href="#3.Towns:Oakshade" title="Oakshade" class="page">Oakshade</a>, an old and wise sage will guide the adventurers on their perilous journey. They will learn of a secret cave, a place where ancient knowledge has been preserved, which may hold the key to understanding the evil that is consuming Astralor. Their journey will be fraught with peril, but their quest is nothing short of epic, as they strive to unravel the secrets of the Tree Gods and free them from the encroaching darkness.
</p>
<br>
<p>
As they venture deeper into the Treehomes, the party will face challenges of both body and spirit. They will encounter monsters of shadow and power beyond imagination, delve into long-forgotten chambers, and uncover the treasures and knowledge that hold the fate of their world in the balance. The <a href="#4.Adventures:1.Cavern of Shadows" title="Cavern of Shadows" class="page">Cavern of Shadows</a> is the first stop on their journey, and the true depths of their quest are yet to be revealed.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The world of Astralor is at a crossroads, and the heroes will need to summon all their strength, courage, and wits to navigate the treacherous path that lies ahead. Theirs is a tale of epic proportions, a story of redemption, courage, and the enduring power of the natural world. Will they rise to the challenge and save their beloved Tree Gods, or will they become lost in the shadows of Astralor's history? Only time will tell.
</p>
<br>

<hr>
<br>
<p>
As the heroes set out from the village of Oakshade, they are faced with the enormity of their task. The ancient journals of <a href="#index:NOTES:Crest Story Arc:Valearian Trorav'sh" title="Valearian Trorav'sh" class="page">Valearian Trorav'sh</a>, a bold explorer who dared to venture into the once-abandoned Treehomes, provide cryptic clues and chilling tales of what lies within. They speak of darkened chambers where monstrous shadows writhe, and of treasures that can only be whispered about.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Their journey is fraught with both wonder and danger. The Treehomes, while immense and magnificent, have become darkened by the insidious blight that corrupts them. Shadows seem to linger even in the daylight, and the air is thick with tension.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The first destination on their quest is the Cavern of Shadows, a place of dread and secrets hidden near the village of Oakshade. It is in this cavern that they hope to find the first thread of truth unraveling the mystery of the blight. However, this cavern is shrouded in darkness, where even the bravest hearts may tremble.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The Cavern of Shadows is not simply a gloomy abyss; it is a gateway to an ancient and forbidden realm. Here, the adventurers will face the unknown. The whispered echoes of the cavern walls will be their only companions as they venture into the abyss, each step bringing them closer to the heart of darkness.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Within the Cavern of Shadows, they will confront malevolent creatures and unearth sinister artifacts. Their every move will be guided by the hope of discovering a fragment of knowledge, a piece of Valearian Trorav'sh's legacy that will illuminate the path ahead.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The prophecy speaks of challenges and revelations, of dangers and triumphs. The world of Astralor is in turmoil, and the Tree Gods need champions to confront the darkness that threatens to consume them. The heroes' destiny is bound to the living heart of the world, and their journey is a testament to the enduring spirit of Astralor.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Their quest to save the Tree Gods, the Dwellers, and the very essence of their world is a tale that will be etched into the annals of history. And with each step they take in the Cavern of Shadows, they come closer to understanding the ancient curse that has befallen Astralor and discovering the path to salvation.

<p>
In an era long past, when the world was plagued by darkness and despair, a great desolation had descended upon a vast land. The once-flourishing nation of <b>Emberholme</b> had fallen into ruin, its once-fertile fields turned to ash, its people living in constant fear and scarcity.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Yet, amidst the desolation, there was a legend that whispered through the generations—a legend of an extraordinary being named Solarenthias. Solarenthias was no ordinary bird but a legendary Firebird, his feathers aflame like the sun. His very existence symbolized passion and rebirth.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Solarenthias had once descended upon Emberholme when all hope seemed lost. He soared through the darkened skies, igniting the heavens with his fiery plumage and casting a brilliant light that banished the shadows that had plagued the land for years. With a fiery sweep of his wings, he rained down flames upon the barren earth. To the astonishment of all, life began to stir from the ashes.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The flames of Solarenthias were not flames of destruction but flames of rejuvenation. With each fiery touch, the land began to bloom once more. Barren fields transformed into lush gardens, and desolate forests burst forth with new growth. Streams of fresh, cool water flowed where none had flowed before, bringing life back to the once-parched land.
</p>
<br>
<p>
As Solarenthias soared above, his hauntingly beautiful song filled the air. It was a song of hope and renewal, and those who heard it felt a surge of determination and inspiration. The people of Emberholme began to rebuild their nation, their spirits rekindled by the presence of this majestic Firebird.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Solarenthias did not stay forever; he had a higher purpose. He promised to return if ever the nation faced a dire threat, but only when the people truly understood the value of life and the importance of unity.
</p>
<br>
<p>
In the centuries that followed, Emberholme thrived once more, and the legend of Solarenthias became a cherished story, passed down from generation to generation. The people of the nation learned to cherish the land and its resources, understanding that their duty was to protect and nurture the world around them.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The ancient Firebird Solarenthias remained a symbol of hope, a reminder that even in the darkest times, the flames of passion and rebirth could rekindle the human spirit and bring life to the most desolate of places. The people of Emberholme believed that one day, when their nation faced its greatest peril, Solarenthias would return to guide them, and together, they would rise from the ashes once more.

Created Wednesday 18 October 2023<br>
<span class="zim-tag">@zodiac</span> <span class="zim-tag">@legends</span>
</p>
<br>
<p>
In a realm where ancient secrets and mysteries intertwined with the very fabric of reality, the Shadowdrake was a creature that embodied the enigmatic nature of this world. With scales as dark as the depths of the cosmos, it was a creature of elusive beauty and profound wisdom.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The Shadowdrake resided in a hidden valley, deep within a remote and shadowy corner of the land. Its sleek, obsidian-black scales seemed to absorb light, rendering it almost invisible in the darkest of nights. Its piercing, intelligent eyes gleamed like polished onyx, and its long, sinuous body allowed it to move through the shadows with grace and silence.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The valley where the Shadowdrake dwelled was shrouded in a perpetual cloak of mist, and its entrance was obscured by a labyrinthine forest of ancient, whispering trees. This place was known as the "<b>Vale of Secrets</b>." Few dared to venture into its depths, for they knew that this valley held secrets that could both enlighten and consume those who sought them.
</p>
<br>
<p>
It was said that the Shadowdrake was the guardian of the Vale of Secrets, a repository of knowledge from ages long past. It held within its ancient mind the answers to riddles that had perplexed scholars for centuries, and the knowledge of how to harness the hidden powers of the land.
</p>
<br>
<p>
One fateful day, a young and curious scholar named Elara entered the Vale of Secrets. She had spent her life studying forgotten lore and yearned to unlock the mysteries concealed within the dark valley. Elara was drawn to the whispers of the ancient trees and the lure of the Shadowdrake's wisdom.
</p>
<br>
<p>
As she ventured deeper into the vale, the mist thickened, and the shadows grew longer. The air was filled with an eerie silence, broken only by the rustling of leaves and the distant, echoing riddles of the Shadowdrake. Elara encountered numerous challenges and puzzles along the way, each designed to test her intellect and resolve.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Eventually, she reached the heart of the vale, where the Shadowdrake awaited her. It regarded her with those piercing, intelligent eyes, and Elara felt a mixture of trepidation and awe. The creature posed a riddle, a question that held the key to a long-forgotten secret of the world.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Elara, drawing upon all her knowledge and experience, <b>solved the riddle</b>, and in that moment, the Shadowdrake shared with her the mysteries of the universe. It revealed the lost arts of ancient magic, the secrets of the cosmos, and the wisdom of the ages. Elara's understanding of the world deepened, and she left the Vale of Secrets with newfound knowledge that would change the course of her life.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The Shadowdrake's role as the guardian of the vale was not to hoard its knowledge but to test those who sought it, to ensure that they were worthy of the wisdom it held. It remained in the shadows, waiting for the next seeker to enter the vale and unlock the secrets that would illuminate the path to a deeper understanding of the world.
</p>
<br>
<p>
And so, the legend of the Shadowdrake and the Vale of Secrets continued, a timeless testament to the enduring pursuit of knowledge and the enigmatic nature of the world itself.

<h3>Trap 1<a id="trap-1" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>
<p>
As your characters cautiously make their way through the dimly lit catacombs beneath the City of Whispers, they come upon a narrow, musty corridor. Cobwebs hang like shrouds from the cracked, ancient stonework. As you proceed, you begin to notice that the path ahead seems more precarious than you first thought. Your eyes catch something glinting in the dim light, and as you draw nearer, a sense of danger takes hold.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Before you, partially hidden amidst the shadows and rubble, you discern a peculiar contraption. A mechanism, intricate yet ancient, seems to be embedded within the cold stone floor. The mechanism consists of a series of tightly wound gears and springs, all intricately designed to serve one sinister purpose.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Closer inspection reveals a crude, makeshift tripwire strung across the corridor. Beyond it, an eerily quiet chamber stretches out with walls lined with the solemn, carved faces of the departed. A musty chill pervades the air. The silence in the chamber is disrupted only by the faint echoes of your own breath and footfalls.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Upon the ceiling, cunningly concealed, is a dark recess from which the trap lies in wait. At its core, a shaft descends from the shadows, with a sharpened steel tip glinting wickedly at the end. It's a spear trap, a weapon of old, carefully aimed at an angle to strike down intruders from above.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The potential consequences of setting off this trap are clear: a swift, deadly projectile, aimed with uncanny precision, will be released. The steel-tipped spear hurtles towards its target with unerring accuracy.
</p>
<br>
<p>
You know that to disarm this devious contraption, you must exercise caution and precision. The Search DC to locate this trap amidst the dimly lit corridor is 20. Disarming the trap requires an intricate touch and knowledge of its inner workings, with a Disable Device DC of 20. Proceed with care, and remember that your movements can be the difference between life and death in these ancient, echoing catacombs.
