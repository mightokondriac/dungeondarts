<b>Children</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Very young children should never be allowed to play with darts. Darts can cause serious injuries to a toddler if they poke themselves in the eye.</li>
<li>Older children should be supervised at all times when playing the game.</li>
<li>It's a good idea to buy youngsters a set of soft tipped darts and board. The board is made of plastic and has small holes cast into it. The soft tip darts stick to the board in the small holes. This type of dart is a lot safer than metal tipped ones and are less likely to cause an injury if they strike anyone. .</li>
<li>Never leave flights lying around as a toddler can put them in their mouth and choke on them.</li>
<li>Keep your darts somewhere that is out of reach of small children.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Dart Safety</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Never set up your dartboard on the back of a door. Anyone who is not aware that you are playing could easily be struck if they opened the door.</li>
<li>Make sure the dartboard is securely fitted to the wall. There have been cases when small children, and some adults, have suffered head injuries when a dart board has fallen on them. Darts also rebound more easily if the board is not secured.</li>
<li>Never point, or throw a dart at anyone.</li>
<li>Don't stand near a dartboard when someone is throwing. A dart might rebound and hit you.</li>
<li>Don't walk in front of a dartboard when people are playing.</li>
<li>Make sure the dartboard is set up well away from any busy areas, or anywhere people might be passing.</li>
<li>If watching or playing always stand behind the player.</li>
<li>Make sure anything that is breakable is moved away from the surrounding area. Darts have a habit of rebounding at some strange angles.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Begin by marking off the proper height from the floor on your wall (5’8” or 1.73m). The bottom of the u-shaped channel should be at this height.</li>
<li>Apply the metal Mounting Feet to the back of your dartboard, using the Stabilizer Screws. If your dartboard came with round plastic Spacers instead, use a hammer to nail each one into the back of your dartboard. Make sure they're spaced evenly, making a triangular shape.</li>
<li>Drive the Dartboard Center Screw into the pre-drilled hole, leaving space to hang the dartboard onto the Mounting Bracket. See our additional tips below for proper screw depth.</li>
<li>Use the two Bracket Mounting Screws to install the Mounting Bracket to your wall, using wall anchors if not positioned over a stud.</li>
<li>Place the dartboard onto the Mounting Bracket and check for tightness against the wall. If the dartboard is wobbling, remove and tighten or loosen the Dartboard Mounting Screw as needed.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
<b>Additional Dartboard Hanging Tips</b><br>
Getting the dartboard's center screw height adjusted to the proper depth can be a little tricky. Below is a depth guide illustration to help you understand how much of the screw should be left sticking out of the back of the dartboard.
</p>
<br>
<p>
If the screw is tightened too far into the dartboard (first illustration - see website link), there won't be enough left of it to hook onto the bracket. If the screw isn't screwed into the board enough (second illustration), it will hook onto the bracket but will be off balance and wobbly. It might take a few tries to lower or raise the center screw until the dartboard no longer wobbles.

In the Attack Step, use the amount of Attack Darts your character has available to attempt to hit the AC of the Enemy you are battling.<br>
Attack Darts are "Successful" if they hit the AC(or higher) of the Enemy you are battling, however the exact AC slice is called a "Direct Hit". Direct Hits are the only Success that adds xMods to the resulting Damage Dart.

Base Darts is a reference to the amount of darts your character has to apply to the Attack and Damage stages. Other Status Effects and Abilities can change this number permentently or temporarily.<br>
If you have 3 Base Darts, you use 3 darts in your Attack Step. However if you have an ability that gives you an additional Base Dart, you use 4 darts in the Attack step.

When a Dart fully bounces out of the dartboard(not Stick and Fall) from hitting a wire, that dart is not Recoverable until the Regroup stage on the Round after next.

In the Damage Step, use the amount of Damage Darts your character has available to attempt to hit the highest possible number. Double and Triple rings are not calculated for Damage Darts(if you hit a Triple 20 with a Damage Dart, it is still only 20 damage. If you hit a Triple on the required AC, then the corresponding Damage Dart would be 20x3, dealing 60 damage to the enemy.

<b>Description:</b><br>
The Fighter is a stalwart and skilled combatant, honed through disciplined training and combat experience. They excel in melee combat, demonstrating exceptional weapon proficiency and the ability to wear the heaviest of armor without sacrificing mobility. Fighters are known for their unwavering courage and their innate ability to protect their allies by drawing the attention of foes in battle.

<h3><a href="#2.Classes:2.Cleric" title="Cleric" class="page">Cleric</a><a id="cleric" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>
<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<i><u>Secondary tank. The healer and shield guard of the group.</u></i> <br>
<b>Description:</b><br>
The Cleric is a divine conduit, an emissary chosen to wield the sacred powers granted by the deities of the world. They serve as healers, spiritual guides, and protectors of the faith. With a strong connection to the divine, Clerics channel this energy to mend wounds, purify spirits, and, in dire situations, smite their enemies with righteous fury. Their versatile abilities can turn the tide of battle, bestowing blessings on their comrades to enhance their resilience, or calling down divine retribution on those who threaten the balance of the world. It is the calling of the Cleric to tend to the spiritual and physical needs of their party, whether through powerful healing magic, fortifying wards, or leading their group with unwavering faith.

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<i><u>Tactical. Disabling status effects and evasion, lots of hits.</u></i><br>
<b>Description:</b><br>
The Rogue, often shrouded in darkness and cloaked in mystery, is a master of stealth, guile, and opportunism. Renowned for their cunning wit and nimble agility, they navigate treacherous paths and unforgiving terrain with remarkable dexterity. Rogues are experts in the art of subterfuge, specializing in thievery, traps, and lock-picking. They are not limited to mere pilfering, though; Rogues excel in hand-to-hand combat, utilizing precision and finesse to strike at their adversaries' weakest points. Adept at infiltration and surprise, they can vanish into the shadows in a heartbeat, reappearing to strike with deadly accuracy. With a versatile set of skills and an innate sense for exploiting vulnerabilities, Rogues are invaluable members of any adventuring party, contributing both in subtle, behind-the-scenes operations and open, face-to-face combat.

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<i><u>Strategic. Dealing high yield damage, exploiting vulnerabilities.</u></i><br>
<b>Description:</b><br>
The Sorcerer harnesses the raw, untamed power of arcane energies, channeling them through sheer force of will. These magic users are born with a rare gift, an innate connection to the mystical energies that flow through the world. Unlike the methodical wizards who study spells and incantations, Sorcerers rely on their intuition, their emotions, and their inherent talents to wield magic. They can command the elements, summon mystical allies, and cast devastating spells with a mere thought. Sorcerers often exhibit a deep, intrinsic connection to their chosen element, allowing them to perform incredible feats of destruction, healing, and transformation. Their powers are a double-edged sword, as the same magic that brings life to the world can also bring destruction. Masters of the unpredictable, Sorcerers are forces to be reckoned with, capable of unleashing both catastrophe and salvation with a single incantation.

<p>
First encounter
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Initial Challenge:</b> The doorway to the Cavern of Shadows is sealed by a complex set of locks on the door. Only the most skilled adventurers are able to decipher its riddle. (This must be solved to continue)<br>
Unsolved until you hit: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 (All Players)
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Clear the way</b>: The cavern appears to be collapsed after the entrance and must be cleared to continue. Take caution, as the ceiling seems weakened.<br>
Unresolved until you hit: Bullseye (All Players)
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Enemy(Primary):</b><br>
Shimmersnake<br>
AC: 16<br>
HP: 20<br>
BD: 10<br>
Its scales seem to change color with every heartbeat, a mesmerizing dance of hues that conceal its true nature. The snake's eyes fix on you, glinting with an otherworldly intelligence, and it slithers forward with an unnerving grace. As it draws closer, the room seems to grow colder, and a sense of foreboding settles over you like a heavy shroud.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>@ 1/2 HP</b><br>
<b>Mezmerising Dance</b>: Every first successful Attack Dart, flip a coin. Attack Dart misses on fail.<br>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<b>Treasure</b>: Shimmering Scale(S)(C) - Deflect 5 Damage per round.

</p>
<br>
<p>
2023 (MMXXIII) is the current year, and is a common year starting on Sunday of the Gregorian calendar, the 2023rd year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 23rd year of the 3rd millennium and the 21st century, and the 4th year of the 2020s decade.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The year has seen the decline in severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the WHO ending its global health emergency status in May. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began in 2022 continued, and a series of coups, an armed conflict, and political crises broke out in numerous African nations. In October, Israel declared a state of war against the Gaza Strip following an attack by Hamas. Catastrophic natural disasters included the fifth-deadliest earthquake of the 21st century striking Turkey and Syria, leaving nearly 60,000 people dead, Cyclone Freddy – the longest-lasting recorded tropical cyclone in history – leading to over 1,400 deaths in Malawi and Mozambique, Storm Daniel, which became the deadliest cyclone worldwide since Cyclone Nargis after killing at least 11,000 people in Libya, a major 6.8 magnitude earthquake striking western Morocco, killing 2,960 people, and a 6.3 magnitude triplet earthquake striking western Afghanistan, killing over 1,000 people.
</p>
<br>
<p>
2023 additionally witnessed a banking crisis resulting in the collapse of numerous American regional banks as well as the buyout of Credit Suisse by UBS in Switzerland. Among American banks, the two largest banks which collapsed were Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank, the third and second largest banking collapses in US history respectively. In April, India surpassed China as the world's most populous country.[1]
</p>
<br>
<p>
In the realm of technology, 2023 has seen the continued rise of generative AI models, with increasing applications across various industries. These models, leveraging advancements in machine learning and natural language processing, have become capable of creating realistic and coherent text, images, and music. An AI arms race between private companies has continued since the late 2010s, with Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Google-owner Alphabet today most dominant among firms.[2]

In October's arms, the world transforms,
A whimsical dance, nature performs.
Leaves flutter down in hues of gold,
As autumn's story begins to unfold.

The air is crisp, a gentle chill,
As cozy scarves and sweaters fill the bill.
Pumpkins grin with toothy delight,
In the enchanting glow of Halloween night.

Apples hang from branches low,
Ready for picking in orchards that glow.
With cinnamon and spice, they're baked to perfection,
A delicious treat, a warm confection.

The forest dons a vibrant coat,
A tapestry of red, orange, and gold, remote.
Mushrooms peek from mossy floors,
In hidden realms, nature explores.

October's moon, a harvest's friend,
Casts its silver glow without end.
In the darkness, its light guides the way,
For creatures of the night at play.

Witches cackle, ghosts take flight,
In this whimsical October night.
A season of magic and delight,
As we bid farewell to summer's light.

So let's celebrate this special time,
With apple cider and prose that rhyme.
In October's arms, we find our grace,
In its whimsy and beauty, we find our place.
