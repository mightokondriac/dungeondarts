<b>Our Epic Journey: Crafting a Unique Game</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
This incredible adventure began with just "two guys and a dartboard." We set out to transform the traditional dart game Cricket into a collaborative and imaginative version, infusing it with the spirit of Dungeons and Dragons. The core idea was simple yet groundbreaking: instead of competing individually, we made it collaborative, turning every number into an epic battle with its own hit points.
</p>
<br>
<p>
In this new version, the players collectively focus on a single number, aiming to "deplete" its hit points. Picture it like this: you're facing an enemy with Armor Class 16 (akin to hitting a 16 on the board), and your success in this hit can vary from x1 (hitting the number) to x2 (hitting the double) or x3 (triple) and even x4 (single bullseye) and x5 (double bullseye). Then, we introduced the concept of dealing damage to these foes.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<i>For instance, with your 3 base darts, you might throw a 16, a 4, and then a single bullseye. These are followed by damage darts that deal varying amounts of damage. Let's say you throw a 7 (x1) and then a 16 (x4). The result? A whopping 71 points of damage inflicted on that enemy.</i>
</div>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Our journey didn't stop at combat. We all love a good treasure hunt, and thus, we introduced treasures into the game, each one waiting to be uncovered and claimed. And here we stand today, deeply immersed in crafting powerful items and weaving captivating stories behind them.
</p>
<br>
<p>
We relish in creating adventures that you'd want to replay with your friends again and again. It's the joy of building these intricate worlds, featuring awe-inspiring monsters and enthralling narratives that can span years. Join us on a quest filled with powerful magical items, legendary beasts to battle, and stories to partake in. Our journey has only just begun, and we invite you to become a part of it.

<p>
<b>Children</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Very young children should never be allowed to play with darts. Darts can cause serious injuries to a toddler if they poke themselves in the eye.</li>
<li>Older children should be supervised at all times when playing the game.</li>
<li>It's a good idea to buy youngsters a set of soft tipped darts and board. The board is made of plastic and has small holes cast into it. The soft tip darts stick to the board in the small holes. This type of dart is a lot safer than metal tipped ones and are less likely to cause an injury if they strike anyone. .</li>
<li>Never leave flights lying around as a toddler can put them in their mouth and choke on them.</li>
<li>Keep your darts somewhere that is out of reach of small children.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Dart Safety</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Never set up your dartboard on the back of a door. Anyone who is not aware that you are playing could easily be struck if they opened the door.</li>
<li>Make sure the dartboard is securely fitted to the wall. There have been cases when small children, and some adults, have suffered head injuries when a dart board has fallen on them. Darts also rebound more easily if the board is not secured.</li>
<li>Never point, or throw a dart at anyone.</li>
<li>Don't stand near a dartboard when someone is throwing. A dart might rebound and hit you.</li>
<li>Don't walk in front of a dartboard when people are playing.</li>
<li>Make sure the dartboard is set up well away from any busy areas, or anywhere people might be passing.</li>
<li>If watching or playing always stand behind the player.</li>
<li>Make sure anything that is breakable is moved away from the surrounding area. Darts have a habit of rebounding at some strange angles.</li>
</ul>

<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Begin by marking off the proper height from the floor on your wall (5’8” or 1.73m). The bottom of the u-shaped channel should be at this height.</li>
<li>Apply the metal Mounting Feet to the back of your dartboard, using the Stabilizer Screws. If your dartboard came with round plastic Spacers instead, use a hammer to nail each one into the back of your dartboard. Make sure they're spaced evenly, making a triangular shape.</li>
<li>Drive the Dartboard Center Screw into the pre-drilled hole, leaving space to hang the dartboard onto the Mounting Bracket. See our additional tips below for proper screw depth.</li>
<li>Use the two Bracket Mounting Screws to install the Mounting Bracket to your wall, using wall anchors if not positioned over a stud.</li>
<li>Place the dartboard onto the Mounting Bracket and check for tightness against the wall. If the dartboard is wobbling, remove and tighten or loosen the Dartboard Mounting Screw as needed.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
<b>Additional Dartboard Hanging Tips</b><br>
Getting the dartboard's center screw height adjusted to the proper depth can be a little tricky. Below is a depth guide illustration to help you understand how much of the screw should be left sticking out of the back of the dartboard.
</p>
<br>
<p>
If the screw is tightened too far into the dartboard (first illustration - see website link), there won't be enough left of it to hook onto the bracket. If the screw isn't screwed into the board enough (second illustration), it will hook onto the bracket but will be off balance and wobbly. It might take a few tries to lower or raise the center screw until the dartboard no longer wobbles.

<p>
In the Attack Step, use the amount of Attack Darts your character has available to attempt to hit the AC of the Enemy you are battling.<br>
Attack Darts are "Successful" if they hit the AC(or higher) of the Enemy you are battling, however the exact AC slice is called a "Direct Hit". Direct Hits are the only Success that adds xMods to the resulting Damage Dart.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Attack Darts Explanation:<a id="attack-darts-explanation" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>
<br>
<p>
In the game, "Attack Darts" are your primary resource for engaging in combat and attempting to strike your enemy. These darts are used during the Attack Step, where you try to hit the Armor Class (AC) of the enemy you are battling.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Here's how Attack Darts work</b>:
</p>
<br>
<ol style='padding-left: 30pt' type="1" start="1">
<li><u>Attack Step</u>: During the Attack Step, you'll use the combined number of Attack Darts at your disposal, which includes your Base Darts plus any bonus Attack Darts from various sources. These darts are crucial for determining the success of your offensive actions.</li>
<li><u>Hitting the AC</u>: Attack Darts are considered "Successful" when they hit the AC of the enemy you are battling or exceed it. Successfully hitting the AC is your primary goal during combat.</li>
<li><u>Direct Hits</u>: Within the category of Successful Attack Darts, there's a special level of success known as a "Direct Hit." A Direct Hit occurs when your dart lands precisely on a specific section of the target, such as the bullseye or another designated area.</li>
<li><u>xMods for Direct Hits</u>: Direct Hits are the only type of success that allows you to apply special modifiers (xMods) to the resulting Damage Dart. The specific xMods include:
<ol type="a" start="1">
<li>Double Ring: x2 damage.</li>
<li>Triple: x3 damage.</li>
<li>Bullseye: x4 damage.</li>
<li>Double Bullseye: x5 damage.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<i>Note that Bullseye types are always considered Direct Hits.</i>
</div>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Understanding Attack Darts and the concept of Direct Hits is vital for combat effectiveness in the game. The better you are at achieving Direct Hits, the more damage you can deal to your enemies. Plan your attacks carefully and use your Attack Darts strategically to maximize your damage output and increase your chances of victory in battles.

Base Darts is a reference to the amount of darts your character has to apply to the Attack and Damage stages. Other Status Effects and Abilities can change this number permentently or temporarily.<br>
If you have 3 Base Darts, you use 3 darts in your Attack Step. However if you have an ability that gives you an additional Base Dart, you use 4 darts in the Attack step.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>Base Darts Explanation:</b><a id="base-darts-explanation" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>
<br>
<p>
In the game, "Base Darts" serve as the fundamental unit for assessing and calculating various aspects of gameplay. These darts represent your foundational resource and determine your ability to perform actions, engage in combat, and make decisions throughout the game.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Here's how Base Darts work</b>:
</p>
<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li><u>Dart Allocation</u>: At the start of each turn or encounter, players are allocated a specific number of Base Darts. This allocation is often influenced by your character's class, abilities, and equipment. These darts serve as the pool from which you draw resources for your actions.</li>
<li><u>Resource Management</u>: You'll need to strategically manage your Base Darts during your turn or when making choices in the game. Different actions and decisions may require varying numbers of darts, so it's crucial to use them wisely to achieve your objectives.</li>
<li><u>Influence on Abilities</u>: Base Darts can also impact your character's abilities and the success of your actions. The more Base Darts you allocate to a specific action, the higher your chances of success. It's a balance between conserving darts and using them to your advantage.</li>
<li><u>Combat and Challenges</u>: In combat situations or when facing challenges, you'll typically use Base Darts to determine the outcome. The number of darts allocated can affect the damage you deal, your defense against enemy attacks, and your overall performance in these situations.</li>
<li><u>Dart Upgrades</u>: As you progress in the game and level up, you may acquire upgrades or abilities that allow you to modify the number of Base Darts you receive or how they can be used. These enhancements can significantly impact your gameplay.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
Understanding the role of Base Darts is essential to strategic decision-making and success in the game. Make sure to manage them effectively, adapt to different situations, and explore ways to enhance your Base Dart allocation as you progress in your adventure.

<p>
When a Dart fully bounces out of the dartboard(not Stick and Fall) from hitting a wire, that dart is not Recoverable until the Regroup stage on the Round after next. 
</p>
<br>
<h3>Bounced Darts Explanation:<a id="bounced-darts-explanation" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>
<br>
<p>
In the game, "Bounced Darts" represent darts that do not hit the dartboard properly and fully bounce out after striking a wire or other obstruction. These darts are temporarily unrecoverable until the "Regroup" stage, which occurs during the round that follows the next round. Think of it as akin to rolling a 1 on a six-sided die in Dungeons and Dragons, where a critical failure has occurred.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Here's a breakdown of Bounced Darts and their impact</b>:
</p>
<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li><u>Dart Inaccuracy</u>: When you throw a dart and it hits a wire on the dartboard, it may not stick to the board as intended. Instead, it bounces out of the board, indicating an inaccurate throw.</li>
<li><u>Recovery Delay</u>: Bounced Darts cannot be retrieved immediately. They remain out of play until the "Regroup" stage, which occurs during the round that comes after the next full round of play. This delay reflects the time it takes to find, retrieve, or replace the darts.</li>
<li><u>Gameplay Impact</u>: The delay in recovering Bounced Darts affects your dart resources. You'll need to carefully manage your remaining darts, especially if Bounced Darts accumulate, to ensure you have enough for future throws.</li>
<li><u>Critical Failures</u>: Similar to rolling a 1 in Dungeons and Dragons, Bounced Darts represent an unfortunate and unintended outcome in the game. These critical failures can disrupt your strategy, adding an element of unpredictability to the game.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
Understanding Bounced Darts is important for players to adapt to the occasional setbacks they bring. Plan your throws carefully, consider the risk of hitting wires, and manage your dart resources to maximize your chances of success in the game.

<p>
In the Damage Step, use the amount of Damage Darts your character has available to attempt to hit the highest possible number. Double and Triple rings are not calculated for Damage Darts(if you hit a Triple 20 with a Damage Dart, it is still only 20 damage. If you hit a Triple on the required AC, then the corresponding Damage Dart would be 20x3, dealing 60 damage to the enemy.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Damage Darts Explanation:<a id="damage-darts-explanation" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>
<br>
<p>
In the game, "Damage Darts" represent the resource you use to determine the amount of damage your character inflicts on the enemy during the Damage Step. Understanding how Damage Darts work is crucial for effectively measuring and dealing damage in combat.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Here's how Damage Darts operate</b>:
</p>
<br>
<ol style='padding-left: 30pt' type="1" start="1">
<li><u>Damage Step</u>: During the Damage Step, you'll use the combined number of Damage Darts at your disposal. These darts determine the extent of damage you can deliver to your opponent.</li>
<li><u>Highest Possible Number</u>: Unlike Attack Darts, where you aim for specific sections of the target, with Damage Darts, your goal is to hit the highest possible number on the dartboard. The value you hit represents the amount of damage you inflict.</li>
<li><u>Double and Triple Rings</u>: Notably, double and triple rings on the dartboard are not calculated for Damage Darts. For example, if you hit a Triple 20 with a Damage Dart, it's still considered 20 damage, without any multiplication. However, it's important to distinguish between Attack Darts and Damage Darts:
<ol type="a" start="1">
<li>If you previously hit a Triple on the required AC with an Attack Dart (refer to Attack Darts), and then you hit a 20 with the corresponding Damage Dart, it would result in 20x3 damage, dealing a significant 60 damage to the enemy. This multiplication is specific to the Attack Darts step.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
Understanding Damage Darts is essential for determining your character's damage output during combat. Aim for high numbers to maximize your damage potential and strategically use Damage Darts to defeat your opponents effectively.

<h3>Natural Abilities Explanation:<a id="natural-abilities-explanation" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>
<br>
<p>
In the game, "Natural Abilities" are inherent powers or skills possessed by the player character. These abilities are always active and persist throughout the entire campaign, enhancing your character's capabilities as they level up. Here's a detailed breakdown of Natural Abilities:
</p>
<br>
<ol style='padding-left: 30pt' type="1" start="1">
<li><u>Activation and Duration</u>: When a player gains a level and unlocks a new Natural Ability, that ability immediately becomes active. Unlike other game abilities that may need to be triggered, Natural Abilities are "always active." They remain in effect for the entire duration of the campaign, providing a consistent enhancement to your character's abilities.</li>
<li><u>Exclusion of Enemy Abilities</u>: Players are restricted from acquiring abilities categorized as "Enemy type." This means you can only acquire and activate Natural Abilities that benefit the player character. Enemy-type abilities are typically reserved for non-playable entities within the game.</li>
<li><u>Status Effects</u>: Importantly, status effects, which are in-game conditions or alterations, can target Player Natural Abilities. This means that during the course of the game, various effects, buffs, or debuffs can impact or interact with your Natural Abilities, potentially enhancing or modifying their effects based on the situation.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
Understanding Natural Abilities is critical for players, as these abilities serve as a fundamental and continuous source of enhancement and strategic advantage throughout the campaign. Players must consider how these abilities interact with status effects and manage their characters accordingly.

<h3>Special Abilities Explanation:<a id="special-abilities-explanation" class="h_anchor"></a></h3>
<br>
<p>
In the game, "Special Abilities" are unique powers or skills that can significantly impact the course of gameplay. Understanding how these abilities are activated and when they can be used is crucial. Here's a detailed explanation:
</p>
<br>
<ol style='padding-left: 30pt' type="1" start="1">
<li><u>Self-Targeted Special Abilities</u>: Special Abilities that target only the player using them, including those that affect darts, can be activated at any time. These abilities can be triggered whenever the player deems it strategically advantageous.</li>
<li><u>Player-Targeted Special Abilities</u>: Special Abilities that target all other players in the game require the expenditure of a "Special Ability Point." This activation takes place during the Regroup Stage, a designated phase of the game where players come together to make collective decisions and activate special abilities that affect other players.</li>
<li><u>Special Abilities Targeting Enemies with Status Effects</u>: Special Abilities that target enemies afflicted with a status effect must also be activated during the Regroup Stage. This ensures coordinated and strategic use of these abilities against affected foes.</li>
<li><u>Special Abilities Targeting Enemies with Direct Damage</u>: Special Abilities that focus on causing direct damage to enemies can be activated at any time. These abilities provide players with flexibility in choosing the right moment to unleash their offensive potential.</li>
<li><u>Exclusion of Enemy Abilities</u>: Players cannot gain abilities classified as "Enemy type." This restriction ensures that players have access only to abilities that benefit them, rather than those typically reserved for non-playable entities within the game.</li>
<li><u>Interaction with Status Effects</u>: It's important to note that status effects, which are in-game conditions or alterations, can also target Player Special Abilities. These effects may modify or enhance the outcomes of special abilities, adding an extra layer of strategy and complexity to the game.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
Understanding Special Abilities is vital for players, as they can greatly influence the outcome of the game. Knowing when and how to activate these abilities, and how they interact with status effects, is key to developing effective strategies and gaining an advantage in the gameplay.

<i><u>Secondary tank. The healer and shield guard of the group.</u></i> <br>
<b>Description:</b><br>
The Cleric is a divine conduit, an emissary chosen to wield the sacred powers granted by the deities of the world. They serve as healers, spiritual guides, and protectors of the faith. With a strong connection to the divine, Clerics channel this energy to mend wounds, purify spirits, and, in dire situations, smite their enemies with righteous fury. Their versatile abilities can turn the tide of battle, bestowing blessings on their comrades to enhance their resilience, or calling down divine retribution on those who threaten the balance of the world.

<i><u>Tactical. Disabling status effects and evasion, lots of hits.</u></i><br>
<b>Description:</b><br>
The Rogue, often shrouded in darkness and cloaked in mystery, is a master of stealth, guile, and opportunism. Renowned for their cunning wit and nimble agility, they navigate treacherous paths and unforgiving terrain with remarkable dexterity. Rogues are experts in the art of subterfuge, specializing in thievery, traps, and lock-picking. They are not limited to mere pilfering, though; Rogues excel in hand-to-hand combat, utilizing precision and finesse to strike at their adversaries' weakest points. Adept at infiltration and surprise, they can vanish into the shadows in a heartbeat, reappearing to strike with deadly accuracy. With a versatile set of skills and an innate sense for exploiting vulnerabilities, Rogues are invaluable members of any adventuring party, contributing both in subtle, behind-the-scenes operations and open, face-to-face combat.

<b>Description:</b><br>
The Sorcerer harnesses the raw, untamed power of arcane energies, channeling them through sheer force of will. These magic users are born with a rare gift, an innate connection to the mystical energies that flow through the world. Unlike the methodical wizards who study spells and incantations, Sorcerers rely on their intuition, their emotions, and their inherent talents to wield magic. They can command the elements, summon mystical allies, and cast devastating spells with a mere thought. Sorcerers often exhibit a deep, intrinsic connection to their chosen element, allowing them to perform incredible feats of destruction, healing, and transformation. Their powers are a double-edged sword, as the same magic that brings life to the world can also bring destruction. Masters of the unpredictable, Sorcerers are forces to be reckoned with, capable of unleashing both catastrophe and salvation with a single incantation.

Separating the interface of "information about a thing" vs "the content of this card" - how to display it is starting to make more sense. I want to start including as many technical advantages to this game as possible. qr to voice, responding to events within the card prompted by the player. "heyyy i just got a triple 16" and the app asks "did you just hit a 16(x3)" ... yes.. bang it calculates, you shout, "a 6 and a 12" ... you hit well with your first strike, but on your second and final strike you draw you weapon down through your enemy, doing 36 damage for a total of ____.<br>
and so on. $$$

Basically this game started with the dart game Cricket and how to turn it into a dungeons and dragons version of this game of dart. Simply put we made it collaborative instead of competitive, and each number had hitpoints. meaning that instead of each player having to hit a number individually and closing them out or making points on those numbers, the players focus on a single number and try to "deplete" its hitpoints. for instance, in this version we are trying to hit Armor Class 16(hitting a 16 on the board) and the varying degree of the success of this hit (x1(hitting the number), x2(hitting the double on that number), x3(triple on that number), x4(single bullseye), x5(double bullseye)). Then we were doing damage finally to these enemies. Lets say, with my 3 base darts, i throw a 16, a 4, and then a single bullseye. I then have damage darts that are x1, (missed), x4. I throw a 7(x1) and then a 16(x4) dealing 71 points of damage to that enemy. We then wanted treasure (who doesn't?), so we made treasures you could get. and then here we are. we love making crazy powerful items and stories for and why they are what they are. we love making adventures that you would want to play with your friends over and over again. join our adventure of crazy powerful magical items and badass monsters to fight, and a story to take part in that will last for years. The quest that gives years, not take them.
